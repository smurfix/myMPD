## myMPD v10.0.0 (2022-09-22)

This major release adds concurrent MPD partition support to myMPD. myMPD connects now to all MPD partitions simultaneously and holds partition specific states and settings. Each browser instance can now select the MPD partition to control.

The partition feature should be used with MPD 0.23.9 or newer. There are some anoying partition related bugs in earlier MPD versions.

The syntax of the last_played file has changed. You can convert it with
`sed -r 's/^(.*)::(.*)/{"LastPlayed":\1,"uri":"\2"}/g' /var/lib/mympd/state/last_played > /var/lib/mympd/state/default/last_played_list`

## myMPD v5.2.0 (2019-03-25)

myMPD 5.2.0 supports embedded albumart through a plugin, that uses libmediainfo. It became a plugin because I did not want to introduce any more dependencies. The plugin is build automatically, if libmediainfo is found. The plugin must be enabled in the configuration file.

Another nice feature detects the mpd music_directory automatically, if myMPD connects over a local socket to mpd. If not, you must configure the musicdirectory option in /etc/mympd/mympd.conf. The symlinks within htdocs are no longer needed.

The last feature enables myMPD to send a love song message to a running scrobbling client through the mpd client protocol.

### Changelog

- Feat: get mpd music_directory automatically or through config file
- Feat: support embedded albumart #62
- Feat: love button for external scrobbling clients
- Fix: song change in streams #97

## myMPD v5.0.0 (2019-02-11)

This new myMPD major version brings only a few new features, but the backend code has been completely rewritten. The web server and the mpd client code have been swapped out into their own threads, which communicate with each other with an asynchronous message queue. This provides the necessary flexibility to enhance existing features and implement new ones.

Many thanks to rollenwiese for his work on the docker support for myMPD.

The release code is now compiled with -fstack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -pie for security reasons. myMPD 5 is the first release, that was completely checked with the valingrid memchecker.

WARNING: This release has a new configuration file syntax. You should copy the mympd.conf.dist file over your configuration and customize it.
