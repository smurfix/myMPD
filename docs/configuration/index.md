myMPD has no single configuration file. Most of the options are configureable through the settings dialog in the web ui.

## Command line options

You can set some basic options with command line options. All these options have sane default values and should not be changed for default usage.

The `workdir` option is useful if you want to run more then one instance of myMPD on the same host.

| OPTION | DESCRIPTION |
| ------ | ----------- |
| -c, --config | creates config and exits (default directory: `/var/lib/mympd/config/`) |
| -h, --help | displays this help |
| -u, --user `<username>`| username to drop privileges to (default: `mympd`) |
| -s, --syslog | enable syslog logging (facility: daemon) |
| -w, --workdir `<path>` | working directory (default: `/var/lib/mympd`) |
| -a, --cachedir `<path>` | cache directory (default: `/var/cache/mympd`) |
| -p, --pin | sets a pin for myMPD settings |
{: .table .table-sm }

- Setting a pin is only supported with compiled in ssl support

## Configuration files

At first startup (if there is no ·∫Åorking directory) myMPD tries to autodetect the MPD connection and reads some environment variables.

After first startup all environment variables are ignored and the files in the directory `/var/lib/mympd/config/` should be edited.

| FILE | TYPE | ENVIRONMENT | DEFAULT | DESCRIPTION |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| acl | string | MYMPD_ACL | | ACL to access the myMPD webserver: [ACL]({{ site.baseurl }}/configuration/acl), allows all hosts in the default configuration |
| http_host | string | MYMPD_HTTP_HOST | 0.0.0.0 | IP address to listen on |
| http_port | number | MYMPD_HTTP_PORT | 80 | Port to listen on. Redirects to `ssl_port` if `ssl` is set to `true` |
| loglevel | number | MYMPD_LOGLEVEL | 5 | [Logging]({{ site.baseurl }}/configuration/logging) - this environment variable is always used |
| lualibs | string | MYMPD_LUALIBS | all | [Scripting]({{ site.baseurl }}/references/scripting) |
| scriptacl | string | MYMPD_SCRIPTACL | +127.0.0.1 | ACL to access the myMPD script backend: [ACL]({{ site.baseurl }}/configuration/acl), allows only local connections in the default configuration. The acl above must also grant access. |
| ssl | boolean | MYMPD_SSL | true | `true` = enables https, `false` = disables https |
| ssl_port | number | MYMPD_SSL_PORT | 443 | Port to listen to https traffic |
| ssl_san | string | MYMPD_SSL_SAN | | Additional SAN for certificate creation |
| custom_cert | boolean | MYMPD_CUSTOM_CERT | false | `true` = use custom ssl key and certificate |
| ssl_cert | string | MYMPD_SSL_CERT | | Path to custom ssl certificate file |
| ssl_key | string | MYMPD_SSL_KEY | | Path to custom ssl key file |
| pin_hash | string | N/A | | SHA256 hash of pin, create it with `mympd -p` |
{: .table .table-sm }

You can use `mympd -c` to create the initial configuration in the `/var/lib/mympd/config/` directory.

### MPD autodetection

myMPD tries to autodetect the mpd connection at first startup.

1. Searches for a valid `mpd.conf` file and reads all interesting settings
2. Uses the default MPD environment variables
3. Tries `/run/mpd/socket` and `/var/run/mpd/socket`

| ENVIRONMENT | DEFAULT | DESCRIPTION |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| MPD_HOST | `/run/mpd/socket` | MPD host or path to mpd socket |
| MPD_PORT | 6600 | MPD port |
{: .table .table-sm}

This is done after droping privileges to the mympd user.
