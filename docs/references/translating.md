myMPD has a simple translation framework integrated. It is inspired by polyglot.js.

Following translations are available and maintained:

* English (en-US) - default
* German (de-DE)

User contributed translations:

* Regulary updated:
  * Korean (ko-KR)
* Outdated (not any longer included in build):
  * Dutch (nl-NL)
  * Finish (fi-FI)
  * French (fr-FR)
  * Italian (it-IT)
  * Spanish (es-VE)

Translations are defined in one file per language. The translation files resides under ``<srcdir>/src/i18n/`` and are named by the language code, e.g. ``en-US.txt`` The perl script ``tojson.pl`` creates a combined javascript file from these files.

## Syntax

* First line of the file must be the friendly name of the language (optionally following a blank line)
* A phrase is in one line, in the next line the translation and then one blank line
* ``%{smart_count}`` are used for pluralization
  * `` |||| `` separates the pluralization forms
  * the phrase before is used for number one
  * the phrase after is user for numbers zero or greater than one
  * more pluralization forms can be easily added (please open an issue)
* all other ``%{variables}`` are replaced with values

### Example

```
English

Num playlists
%{smart_count} Playlist |||| %{smart_count} Playlists
```
Expands to ``1 Playlist`` or ``5 Playlists`` or ``0 Playlists``

## Generating the translation file

You can generate the translation file for debug builds manually. The translation file is written to `htdocs/js/i18n.js`. The build process shows all missing or obsolete translations.

``
./build.sh translate
``

## Adding missing translations

This example is for the german translation (de-DE).

1. Show missing translation phrases for one language: `./build.sh translate 2>&1 | grep "de-DE"`
2. Add translation to file: `src/i18n/de-DE.txt`
