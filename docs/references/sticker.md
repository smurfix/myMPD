**playCount is updated:**

- The song must be longer than 10 seconds
- And the song has been played for at least half its duration, or for 4 minutes (whichever occurs earlier)

**skipCount is updated:**

- The song has been played for at least 10 seconds

## Sticker cache

myMPD uses an internal sticker cache to speed up the access. Sticker writes are always delegated to MPD, but reads are always from the cache.
