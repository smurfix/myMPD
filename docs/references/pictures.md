# Albumart

myMPD supports local coverart for albums and streams.

## Albums

myMPD needs access to the MPD music_directory or a uptodate MPD.

### Albumart in directories through direct music directory access

1. If connected through the local MPD socket: myMPD gets the music_directory automatically, if music directory is set to auto.
2. If connected over network: set the music directory option in the connection dialog.

Enable albumart support:

1. To support albumart, songs must be arranged in folders per album.
2. Put the pictures in the album folders, name it always the same, e.g. folder.jpg
3. Configure the name in the settings, a comma separated list and basenames are also supported

### Albumart in directories through MPD

1. only MPD >= 0.21 supports the albumart command
2. Put the pictures in the album folders, the basename must be cover (e.g. cover.jpg)

### Embedded albumart

myMPD can extract embedded albumart, if it can access the music files. If MPD >= 0.22 is detected myMPD can get the embedded albumart through the readpicture command.

#### Covercache

myMPD caches extracted covers under `/var/cache/mympd/covercache`. Files in this directory can be safely deleted. myMPD houskeeps the covercache on startup and each two hours.

***

# Streams

1. Images must be named as the uri of the stream, replace the characters `<>/.:?&$!#\|` with `_`, e.g. `http___stream_laut_fm_nonpop.png` for uri `http://stream.laut.fm/nonpop`.
2. Put these images in the `/var/lib/mympd/pics/thumbs` folder.

# Pictures for other tags

The "Browse Database" grid view can display pictures for other tags than album also. To enable this simply create a directory with the tagname in the `/var/lib/mympd/pics` directory and put pictures with filename equal the tag value in this directory.

## Example

Create a directory named `AlbumArtist` under `/var/lib/mympd/pics`. Add pictures with the AlbumArtist name as filename in this directory.

# Home icon pictures

Pictures for the home icons must be placed in the directory `/var/lib/mympd/pics/thumbs`.

# Background images

Background images must be saved in the `/var/lib/mympd/pics/backgrounds` folder.
