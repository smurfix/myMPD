3. Run following commands to download dependencies recipes:
    ```
    scripts/feeds update -a
    scripts/feeds install libflac libid3tag liblua5.3 libopenssl libpcre2
    ```
4. Copy contents of `contrib/packaging/openwrt` from myMPD tree
   to `package/mympd` directory of SDK.
5. To build package run:
    ```
    make -j$(nproc) BUILD_LOG=1
    ```
6. Resulting package will be placed in 'bin' directory.
