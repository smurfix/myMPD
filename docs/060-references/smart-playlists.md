title: Smart playlists
---

In the default configuration there are no smart playlists. You can add smart playlists in the playlist view or through a saved song search.

## Playlist rule

myMPD can generate smart playlists per tag value, e.g. one playlist for each genre. You can configure the rule in the settings dialog under `General -> Smart playlists`.

## Smart playlists

Smart playlists are saved in the folder `/var/lib/mympd/smartpls` (one JSON file per smart playlist). myMPD creates from this definitions normal MPD playlists on startup, after database changes and a specified interval. You can also enforce an update of all smart playlists in the maintenance dialog in the gui.
