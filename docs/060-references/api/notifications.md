title: Websocket Notifications
---

myMPD uses the idle protocol from mpd to detect state changes. These status changes and myMPD changes are broadcasted to all open websocket connections, respecting the partition specificity.

The websocket is also used to notify the user about the status of asynchronous operations and for script dialogs.

**Websocket endpoint:** `/ws/<partition>`
